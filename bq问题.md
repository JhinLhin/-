掌握以下这些，基本覆盖 90% 的 BQ 场景。用 **STAR 法则**（Situation → Task → Action → Result）回答。

## **零、开场白**

#### 自我介绍

- "Hi, I'm Jinlin. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, and I'm currently pusring my Master's with a specialization in Machine Learning there as well. I do have experience in full-stack development and cloud infrastructure, primarily using Java, Spring Boot, Vue and AWS."
- "Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer Intern at **Philips** on the Clinical Insights & AI Team. Most of my work currently focused on building data pipelines and optimizing cloud infrastructure. For example, I built a real-time clinical analytics dashboard using a completely serverless AWS pipeline involving **NiFi, DynamoDB, Lambda, and AppSync**. I also did a few infrastructure optimization by using **EventBridge Scheduler and SSM Automation and Lambda function** to automate EC2 instance/and ECS services start/stop schedules, which reduced our cloud operational costs."
- "Before Philips, I spent 8 months at **nCino** as a Software Engineer Intern. (It's a cloud based banking platform, the vast majority of there applications are running on Salesforce). There, I worked on a commercial pricing and profitability team, where I built a scalable front-end architecture using Lightning Web Components and integrated it with Apex logic layer (Apex is almost exactly the same java with less library and stuff). One of my proudest contributions was delivering an enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodeBuild**, which automated our testing and ensured 99% reliability for mission-critical lending decisions."
- "Besides work, I also did built a few full-stack projects using Vue 3 and Spring Boot, like a rental platform and a news aggregator, to keep my web development skills. I also got my Cybersecurity License last summer.
- And lastly, I do not need sponsorship and I do have U.S. citizenship and currently looking for full-time opportunities"

#### 公司了解

- On a surface level, I know you guys is a Visa is a payments technology company. Visa isn’t a bank and you guys don't lend any money. I think the core role is connecting customers/ financial instituions so the payment can move move around the world. I also heard about your VisaNet, which is kind of like a electronic payment networks that transfers money and process millions of transactions every single day. I wanna guess that most of your backend relies heavily on **Java, Spring Boot** because Java is the most commonly used programming languages in the finance. 
- （这个可以不说）Also read about your core values, like **Lead courageously（勇于领导）**, **Obsess about customers（对客户痴迷）**, **Collaborate as one Visa（作为一个团队协作）**, 以及 **Execute with excellence（卓越执行）**。

#### 长处和短处

长处

- 

短处

- **`Hoping for something that is very unlikely to happen`**

  I tend to hope for the best outcome, even when it’s unlikely—like when I applied to MIT, or after an exam, hoping for a perfect score. People always say that you should always have hope for the goods but if you had too much hope and things went bad, then all the hope you have accumulated while waiting for the result might turn into a huge amount of negativity at once and that can be tough to handle.

- **Walmart:**

  One of my weaknesses is that I have a hard time saying no, especially when it comes to helping people. When I worked part-time jobs, my coworkers would always call me to cover their shifts if, and even when I had other stuff going on, I’d usually say yes because I felt bad turning them down. It’s the same with customers—sometimes they’d ask to open a product before buying it, and I’d try to explain why they shouldn’t, but in the end, some customer would still open it after I walk away. 

- Worry about stuff that has not happen yet.

#### 项目

- One project I’m really proud of is an **Apartment Rental Platform** I developed, which has two parts: a mobile platform for users and an admin platform for management. On the mobile side, users can search for available apartments, check out pictures, prices, and details, and even make appointments by selecting time slots. They can also view, submit, or terminate their lease contracts and keep track of their browsing history. On the admin side, they can manage apartment listings, add new ones, update details, or delete them. Admins can also handle user accounts and view all incoming appointments. I built the front end using Vue, and for the backend, I used Spring Boot, MyBatis Plus, Spring MVC, and MySQL. The toughest part was definitely managing over 25 tables in the database with complex SQL queries, but for the front end, I could lean on existing UI designs, which made things easier.

- (In terms of the functionalities, it is kind of a simpler version of the first one)Another project I took initiative on was a **Top News Platform**, where users can sign up, log in, and post news articles. Once logged in, they can create, edit, or delete posts, search through them, and sort them using keywords. I used Vue3 with Element Plus for the front end and Spring Boot 3 with MyBatis Plus and MySQL for the backend. Similar to the rental app, writing SQL queries for multiple tables was the biggest challenge, along with figuring out how to structure the front end.

#### Taken/Favorite class

#### 为何选该行业

#### 为什么要招你

- "To keep it short, I think I’m a great fit for two main reasons: **my FinTech background, and my cloud experience.**
- First, from my time at **nCino**, I spent 8 months building pricing software for enterprise banks. So I already have that 'zero-room-for-error' mindset. I know how to set up strict CI/CD pipelines and write robust code, because in FinTech, things just have to work perfectly 24/7.
- Second, I’m already used to the kind of scale Visa operates at. Right now at my **Philips** co-op, I’m building real-time, serverless AWS pipelines day-to-day using NiFi and DynamoDB. Handling massive, event-driven data flows is exactly what I’m doing right now.
- So honestly, I feel like I won't need a huge ramp-up time. I already speak the FinTech language, I know the cloud infrastructure, and I can just jump in and start contributing right away."

## **一、Leadership / Influence（领导力）**

#### 领导经历

**TA**

- **Situation:** I was a Teaching Assistant for the University of Pittsburgh’s CS 0007 Introduction to Computer Programming class, which taught basic Java. The class was open to all majors with no prerequisites, so we covered really basic concepts like data types, loops, and arrays. Since it was a mixed group, some students had zero coding experience, while others were already pretty good at it.

  **Task:** My job was to help during the weekly labs, answer questions in office hours, grade assignments and exams, and respond to questions on the Ed platform. I guess the hardest part was finding the right balance—helping those who were completely new to coding. Also ensure that those more advanced students won't feel bored.

  **Action: **To handle that, I always start by asking students about their thought process, so I could understand where they were coming from. Then, I’d explain things from their perspective, sometimes breaking it down in different ways until it made sense. The goal was to keep everyone felt supported, no matter their experience.  Also, this was also around the time ChatGPT first came out, and some students were trying to use it for assignments. We didn’t know how to handle it because it was such a new thing to all the American universities, so we had to make sure to that GPT cannot solve our assignment questions, or write the question in a tricky way so that GPT will get it wrong every single time.

  **Result:** This experience really helped me learn how to explain complicated ideas in simple, easier to understand way and how to adjust my approach depending on who I was working with.

## **七、成长与学习**

#### 未来职业计划/Dream Job

- In the next five years, I see myself working primarily in backend development with Java springboot, springcloud microservice, or maybe full stack, to build up my skills and experience. Along the way, **I want to dive deep into Cybersecurity, either by getting the necessary licenses and certifications or getting an online master while working. My goal is to eventually make a shift from backend development into Cybersecurity. I think the combination of both skill sets will give me a lot of opportunities in the future.**
- 问的是Dream的话下面再加上这个：Also, I think Cybersecurity seems to be cool because the general impression when I was young about programming is like those hacker in the movie.

#### 感兴趣的方向

- Initially, it was frontend because I learned html css, js right after my first programming language java, it was interesting because you get to see the stuff instantly, instant feedback and feel accomplished. Feels like drawing pictures. I also realize that it is quite timing consuming to make a nice website from scratch and especially with the recent advance in AI that can even make a website for you by your verbal description.

  then I learned backend sprinboot and learned how to implement a database, how to receive request from the frontend, and how to send the result back to the frontend. I want to dive deep into Cybersecurity, either by getting the necessary licenses and certifications or getting an online graduate master while working. My goal is to eventually make a shift from backend development into Cybersecurity. 

#### 自学了新的技术

- **Over the summer, I taught myself Spring, SpringMVC, SpringBoot, and Vue by using online resources, tutorials, official documentation, and I did some full stack projects during my free time. Lately, ChatGPT has made this process even smoother—it’s like a huge time-saver.** Instead of searching through Google for answers, GPT just gives me what I need directly. Honestly, I think it’s one of the best inventions of the 21st century because it’s helped me learn so much faster. **Right now, I’m working on learning Spring Cloud microservices because I think it will be useful in the future.**
- If I have others around me or I am in School， Just don't be afraid, always ask for help, no one knows you are struggling until you reach out)

## 技术方面

### **Agile:**

- It is like a software development methodology. It is very theory based. It breaks up the project development into multiple stages, you can also call that sprints. You have to follow Plan, Design, Develop, Test, Deploy, and Review these 6 steps for each sprint.
- Did not strictly following these because let's say that you are on sprint 3 doing Testing and some stuff in sprint 1 went wrong. You probably won't go through the same steps for sprint 1 again.

------

### **Jira：**

![image-20241011115636563](C:\Users\xuyih\OneDrive\桌面\面试准备\来时的路\破题图片\image-20241011115636563.png)

- It’s basically a tool that helps teams manage their work, especially for software development. You can track tasks, bugs, and projects all in one place. I know it’s pretty common for agile development. It’s super helpful for keeping everyone on the same page. Honestly, It's kind of like an advanced version of google calendar. You basically have 4 columns on the board. You have TO DO, In Progress, Code Review, and Done. Everyone just gets their own ticket, and once you are done just move your ticket forward to a different column


------

### **Scrum:**

- Scrum is an Agile framework that helps manage software projects. It breaks project into smaller part called sprints, which usually last for a few weeks. It involves three main roles: You have the **Product Owner**, who prioritizes tasks based on the needs; the **Scrum Master**, who makes sure everyone follows the process smoothly; and the **Development Team**, who builds the product. 

- 下面的如果问了才说不然显得假：Work is organized in a **Product Backlog** (all the features and tasks) and a **Sprint Backlog** (what we plan to do in the current sprint). Key meetings include **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Stand-Ups** to track progress, **Sprint Reviews** to get feedback, and **Retrospectives** to improve for next time. 

------

### **Git:**

- Git has **four stages**:
  1. **Working Directory**: Where you modify files locally.
  2. **Staging Area**: Use `git add` to stage changes for the next commit.
  3. **Local Repository**: Commit staged changes using `git commit`, creating a version in your local repo.
  4. **Remote Repository**: Push local commits to a shared remote repo (e.g., GitHub) using `git push` for collaboration and backup.

1. **Repositories**:

- **Repository** stores project files and history, either **local** or **remote** (e.g., GitHub).
- **Clone**: `git clone` copies a remote repo to your local machine.

2. **Staging and Commits**:

- **Staging Area**: `git add <filename>` adds files to prepare for commit.
- **Commit**: `git commit -m "message"` creates a version snapshot.

3. **Branches**:

- **Branch**: `git branch <branch-name>` creates a branch for separate work. Switch with `git checkout`.
- **Merge**: `git merge <branch-name>` integrates changes from one branch to another.

4. **Pull and Push**:

- **Push**: `git push origin <branch-name>` shares commits to a remote repo.
- **Pull**: `git pull` fetches and merges changes from the remote repo.

5. **Status and Logs**:

- **Status**: `git status` shows the state of your working directory.
- **Log**: `git log` displays commit history.

6. **Fetch and Rebase**:

- **Fetch**: `git fetch` downloads changes without applying them.
- **Rebase**: `git rebase <branch-name>` repositions commits to keep branches up to date.

7. **Undoing Changes**:

- **Reset**: `git reset` undoes commits.
- **Revert**: `git revert <commit>` undoes a specific commit while preserving history.
- **Checkout**: `git checkout -- <filename>` discards changes in a file.

**Git Workflow**:

- Create **feature branches** for individual tasks.
- Use **pull requests** for code reviews before merging.

### **REST(RESTFUL) API(representational state transfer):**

- RESTful is a software architectural style based on HTTP ,and it is a standard design principle.

- It teaches you => how to design access paths, set request parameter types, and choose request methods.

- Each resource is identified by URI, and we access them through URL:**URI 就像人的名字，用来识别谁是谁，而 URL 就像地址，告诉你如何找到这个人。URL is a subset of URI. **Every URL is a URI because it identifies and locates a resource. Not every URI is a URL.

- 使用标准的 HTTP 方法:

  - `GET`: 用于获取资源。可以通过浏览器地址栏直接输入 URL 来发起。问号后面加参数
  - `POST`: 用于创建新资源。需要通过表单提交、JavaScript、或工具（**如 Postman**）来发起。
  - `PUT`: 用于更新资源。需要通过表单提交、JavaScript、或工具（**如 Postman**）来发起。
  - `DELETE`: 用于删除资源。需要通过表单提交、JavaScript、或工具（**如 Postman**）来发起。

- **资源的表现形式是 JSON 或 XML**: 数据通常以 JSON 或 XML 格式传输。

- 传统风格的 URL 通常带有动词，如 `/CRUD/saveEmp`，而 RESTful 风格的 URL 使用名词表示资源，如 `/CRUD/emp`。

  | 操作 | 传统风格                  | RESTful 风格                          |
  | ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | 保存 | `/CRUD/saveEmp`           | URL: `/CRUD/emp` 请求方式: `POST`     |
  | 删除 | `/CRUD/removeEmp?empId=2` | URL: `/CRUD/emp/2` 请求方式: `DELETE` |
  | 更新 | `/CRUD/updateEmp`         | URL: `/CRUD/emp` 请求方式: `PUT`      |
  | 查询 | `/CRUD/editEmp?empId=2`   | URL: `/CRUD/emp/2` 请求方式: `GET`    |

### Hackathon:

I have done one of them back when I was freshman in the university of Pittsburgh, I did my freshman year there then I transferred to Georgia Tech.  It was sponsored by the their School of Pharmacy because Pitt is famous for its on medical field and healthcare, they have UPMC, and this hackathon was related to healthcare. My team and I didn’t have much experience in the healthcare, so it was very hard for us and we didn’t end up winning any prizes. But it was a really valuable experience. And I remember their awards were very good, the first place gets 3000 dollars, second place was 2000 and 1000 for the third place.
