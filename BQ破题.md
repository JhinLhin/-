**STAR stands for:** 

- Situation – Task – Action - Result

**拖时间：That's a great question, let me think about it. thanks for asking that!** 

##开场白

- Good Morning, XXX. Happy xxx Day. How are you doin?

### 自我介绍

- Hi, I am Jin. I am currently a first year Master Student, majoring in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  It's a part-time program.  Speak of experience, I am currently working as a software engineer intern for nCino. And, nCino is a financial technology company. In simple terms, they make applications for financial institutions, like banks and stuff.  
  
  The vast majority part of their existing applications are based off salesforce. Most of my work involved writing code and fixing stuff in Salesforce LWC and in Apex. LWC stands for lightning web component, it is salesforce's frontend framework, super similar to React or Vue. And Apex is salesforce's backend language, almost exactly the same Java but with less libraries and features. 
  
  I helped build or improve features for our customers to use to manage loans and pricing. Also worked with other full-time developers, went through code reviews, and we do followed Agile development practices like daily standups and we use Jira to keep track of our tasks.
  
  Ahh, Did a few full stack projects, I like to use java Springboot for backend and Vue for frontend and MySQL for databases. I also got my cybersecurity license CompTIA Security+ this past summer, back in June.
  
  Lastly, Kind of a cliche, but I have taken most of relevant courses like DSA, computer networking, Databases, Organization, OS.
  
  Yea, that was my intro.
  

### **公司了解**

- At a very surface level, I know you guys are a financial technology company. And a lot of your clients are from wall street, which is very impressive.  I was also referred by Jose, who interned with me at nCino (nCino is also a financial technology company) this past summer and later accepted a full-time offer at Galatea — I also heard about his positive experience which motivates me to apply."


### **Taken/Favorite class**

- Applied Combinatorics, Computer Organization, Computer Systems and Networks, Data Structure and Algorithm, Database Systems, Discrete Mathematics, Introduction to Object Oriented Programming, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Multivariable Calculus, and Object and Design 

- One of my favorite classes at Georgia Tech has definitely been Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It’s been super useful, especially for interview prep—it really helps you think through coding problems in a clear, logical way. I also loved Object-Oriented Design because it taught me how to structure bigger projects and write code that’s easy to reuse and how to work with others Using Github. Another one was Computer Organization. We dove into things like calling conventions, bit manipulation, and C programming. We even worked with Assembly and built out the data path for the LC-3 processor. 

### Project(s)

- One project I’m really proud of is an **Apartment Rental Platform** I developed, which has two parts: a mobile platform for users and an admin platform for management. On the mobile side, users can search for available apartments, check out pictures, prices, and details, and even make appointments by selecting time slots. They can also view, submit, or terminate their lease contracts and keep track of their browsing history. On the admin side, they can manage apartment listings, add new ones, update details, or delete them. Admins can also handle user accounts and view all incoming appointments. I built the front end using Vue, and for the backend, I used Spring Boot, MyBatis Plus, Spring MVC, and MySQL. The toughest part was definitely managing over 25 tables in the database with complex SQL queries, but for the front end, I could lean on existing UI designs, which made things easier.

- (In terms of the functionalities, it is kind of a simpler version of the first one)Another project I took initiative on was a **Top News Platform**, where users can sign up, log in, and post news articles. Once logged in, they can create, edit, or delete posts, search through them, and sort them using keywords. I used Vue3 with Element Plus for the front end and Spring Boot 3 with MyBatis Plus and MySQL for the backend. Similar to the rental app, writing SQL queries for multiple tables was the biggest challenge, along with figuring out how to structure the front end.
- I also worked on a **College Scheduler App** that helps students manage their schedules, assignments, exams, and to-do lists. It was a group project with three people, and I handled most of the front-end work. The database was simple, mainly for storing login and class information. The hardest part was getting used to Android Studio, which was a bit different from other tools I’ve used. I’m not a huge fan of it because it uses XML for both front-end design and dependencies, which threw me off since I’m more used to Maven.
- Another fun project was **Schmotify**, which is like a lightweight version of Spotify. It allows users to see a summary of their listening habits throughout the year, and the data is saved locally. I worked on the front end, designing the login page, recommendation page, and settings page using Android Studio’s XML files. This was a group project with six people, and we were all new to the technology, but everyone was super nice and collaborative. We used Firebase, Android Studio, ChatGPT API, and Spotify API. The hardest part was making API calls since none of us had done it before, and we ran into compatibility issues with Gradle. But we pushed through by using online resources, GPT-3.5 (which wasn’t as powerful as today’s version), and asking our TAs for help. In the end, we created a music recommendation feature that takes a user’s listening habits, sends them to GPT, and displays personalized music recommendations.

### 为什么选择该工作:

**为什么选择该专业/工作？**

- **My Uncle actually has a Computer Application degree back then.** Either, they did not have computer science degree back then, or he did not get in. Anyway, I was in elementary school, the market was nice and people were less stressed. So, everyday after work, he has nothing to do, so he just play video game (plants vs zombies/ angry birds), and me since I was too young, I always got distracted by him. So he got me into playing them. But since I was too young, I sucked at every game, so I was browsing online to learn how to pass the game, then I came across the external software (or called cheat software), they basically modified the game and give your unlimited resources(sun, money, etc). Then I ran into another difficulty, how do you integrate the software into the game? That was the very first interaction I had with software engineering. That wasn't exactly SWE, but that was as close as I can get.

  There are two types of people in general. Some people are fortunate enough that they can turn their hobby into their career. Other people are engaged in the career out of the necessity because they have to support themselves. I think I belong to the first group, I am trying to turn my hobby into my career. But, career and hobby are different, there is a lot of responsibilities that goes along with the career and you have to perform your duty on a daily basis. You can not do things however you want it. You have to balance the risk and cost before every move. I have not sure if it is going affect my original passion for the field but I am sure that I am excited and ready for whatever is coming next. Environment is also a crucial factor in shaping my passion maybe xxx company can help me on that one.  

## **团队合作（Teamwork）**

### 超常发挥（beyond expectation）

**找一些没说过的去对应的部分：**

- 意料之外的情况
- 遇到困难Get Stuck
- Project要求临时改变
- 快速决定且多方信息矛盾
- 挑战。。。
- 舒适圈外

**学校project：**

- **Situation**:
  In one of my group projects for the Object and Design CS class, we were building a college scheduler app, using GitHub for version control. It was basically an app to help people keep track of their schedule. Each of us had our own branch to work on specific parts of the project, and the plan was to merge everything back to the main branch after comparing and putting the pieces together.

  **Task**:
  It was during finals week, and I felt like we were falling behind because everyone was busy studying for their exams. I had my own part done early, but instead of just waiting, I jumped ahead and started working on tasks that were assigned to my teammates.

  **Action**:
  I was moving fast, but I wasn’t merging my branch with the main branch as often as I should, and I wasn’t updating my team about the changes I was making. By the time we got together to merge everything, our implementations were different. I had to explain what I did and help fix a bunch of merge conflicts.

  **Result**:
  In the end, we got everything sorted out and we actually were able turn in the assignment one or two days before it's due, and my teammates were happy about the result as well because it was less work for them, but I definitely learned a lot from that experience. It was my first group project, and it taught me how important communication is. Now, I make sure to keep everyone always informed when working with a team.

### 团队合作的经验:(Group Work)

**Please describe a specific time you joined a team and worked with them to accomplish a common goal. Describe the situation, your actions, and the outcome.**

**If you get stuck on something(Walmart)**

- **Walmart:** 

  During my job at Walmart in high school, for some reason they were always short-staffed, so they would just send me and other part times into different departments to them help out. It was a very unique experience because I had to not only learn how to work within my own department (I work for the outdoor and garden) and I also had to learn how to work with new departments(I think I have worked in diary, electronics, OGP online grocery pickup, cashier, stocking, housing etc.) and different managers. Also, I had to learn how to deal with different customers as well because they might ask questions specific to that department that I do not know. Like for cashier, some I had verify their ID before they purchase alcohol or other stuff. For electronics, they might ask me the functionality of certain product, for garden they would ask me like plants specific questions 

  **What really helped was focusing on communication and collaboration. Just don't be afraid of rejections, always ask for help, be honest with customer if you do not know something. With coworkers I made sure we were all on the same page by listening to others' ideas, and sharing my own. I just tried to keep things moving forward.** In the end, even when we were understaffed, we managed to get everything done, and it showed me just how important teamwork and clear communication are.

- **TA:**

  During my TA time, I had to work with the professor and other TAs, we have to handling everything like grading homework, quizzes, and exams, we have to host weekly office hours and labs to help students with their assignments and review lectures. I always communicate with other TAs to make sure that we are consistent and fair with the students. Sometimes, if students are confused about certain concepts, I had to figure out where their confusion was first, and try to respond it a easier to understand way. If there was a grading error, I’ll verify because sometimes it is not a grading error but they think it is, If it is I apologize, and fix their grade. Other times, they would request extensions on homework, so I have to talk with the head TA. And if there were cases of cheating during exams, I would discuss the situation with the other TAs and the professor to figure out how to handle it. Overall, it was about being consistent with the team and making sure we are effectively.



### More Collaborative Approach:

**Time that I could have taken a more collaborative approach to working with a team**

- **Situation**:
  In one of my group projects for the Object and Design CS class, we were building a college scheduler app, using GitHub for version control. It was basically an app to help people keep track of their schedule. Each of us had our own branch to work on specific parts of the project, and the plan was to merge everything back to the main branch after comparing and putting the pieces together.

  **Task**:
  It was during finals week, and I felt like we were falling behind because everyone was busy studying for their exams. I had my own part done early, but instead of just waiting, I jumped ahead and started working on tasks that were assigned to my teammates.

  **Action**:
  I was moving fast, but I wasn’t merging my branch with the main branch as often as I should, and I wasn’t updating my team about the changes I was making. By the time we got together to merge everything, our implementations were different. I had to explain what I did and help fix a bunch of merge conflicts.

  **Result**:
  In the end, we got everything sorted out and we actually were able turn in the assignment one or two days before it's due, and my teammates were happy about the result as well because it was less work for them, but I definitely learned a lot from that experience. It was my first group project, and it taught me how important communication is. Now, I make sure to keep everyone always informed when working with a team.

有一次manager叫我和mentor一起做ticket结果我自己先做完了。

## 领导力（Leadership and Initiative）

**TA**

- **Situation:** I was a Teaching Assistant for the University of Pittsburgh’s CS 0007 Introduction to Computer Programming class, which taught basic Java. The class was open to all majors with no prerequisites, so we covered really basic concepts like data types, loops, and arrays. Since it was a mixed group, some students had zero coding experience, while others were already pretty good at it.

  **Task:** My job was to help during the weekly labs, answer questions in office hours, grade assignments and exams, and respond to questions on the Ed platform. I guess the hardest part was finding the right balance—helping those who were completely new to coding. Also ensure that those more advanced students won't feel bored.

  **Action: **To handle that, I always start by asking students about their thought process, so I could understand where they were coming from. Then, I’d explain things from their perspective, sometimes breaking it down in different ways until it made sense. The goal was to keep everyone felt supported, no matter their experience.  Also, this was also around the time ChatGPT first came out, and some students were trying to use it for assignments. We didn’t know how to handle it because it was such a new thing to all the American universities, so we had to make sure to that GPT cannot solve our assignment questions, or write the question in a tricky way so that GPT will get it wrong every single time.

  **Result:** This experience really helped me learn how to explain complicated ideas in simple, easier to understand way and how to adjust my approach depending on who I was working with. 

**Jobs**

- **Situation:** In high school, I had two part-time jobs—one at Hy-Vee and the other one at Walmart. At Hy-Vee, I worked for only one department, and sometimes I was also responsible for training new employees on how to interact with customers and handle their daily tasks. At Walmart, I had a similar role, but the work itself was very different.

  **Task:** At Hy-Vee, my job was to focus on one department and train new hires on how to do their work and provide good customer service. Walmart was a bit more fast-paced, and I ended up working in multiple departments because they’d call me in whenever they were short-staffed. So, I had to quickly learn each department’s responsibilities, so I could help wherever I was needed.

  **Action:** In both jobs, I had to train others and making sure new employees know how to do their jobs. At Walmart, I had to be even more adaptable, since I was constantly switching between different roles and interacting with a wider range of people. My priority was to learn quickly and build relationships with my team, no matter which department I was in.

  **Result:** These jobs taught me a lot about leadership, flexibility, and teamwork. I got comfortable handling different tasks and working with a variety of people, , which I think will be really useful in a software engineering role.

## 沟通技能（Communication Skills）

### 冲突处理 Conflict

**General Approach**

- I've had experience both in academic settings and on the job.
- For the academic conflicts, like whenever I have a group project, and we might have different implementation for the same functionality, or after any exam when we have different solutions to the same questions.
- I think If they are currently very angry, you might need to wait for a while until their emotion is stable because people lost their rationality when they are mad.

- Usually, I have to communicate with them to ensure that I fully understand their standpoint, and fully express my own opinion as well because most conflicts are due to the lack of communication. Then I would evaluate the pros and cons of both opinions to see which one would be better for the given scenario. Based on that I would either just adopt his approach, or to see if it is possible to convince him to accept my approach, or if we can both compromise a little to reach a mutual agreement.

**Walmart 应对顾客**

- Working at Walmart is quite different because sometimes coworkers have conflicts between each other, or other times you might even have to deal with frustrated customers. With coworkers, the key is usually similar to group projects—clear communication. 

- When it comes to customers, it’s all about staying calm and patient. Sometimes customers are upset about things that are out of my control, like a product being out of stock or long wait times. In those situations, I just listen to their concerns and show empathy, even if I can’t fix the problem right away. I find that people just want to feel heard. If I can offer a solution, great—if not, I do my best to find someone who can help.

### 承认错误

**Took responsibility for a mistake/failure**

- I was working part-time at Hy-Vee in the food department.  After the cook done a dish he have to put it into a metal pan, and to keep the food hot you have to turn on the steam table below so it will heat up the water in it to keep the above pan hot. And one day I forgot to turn on the steam table.  A customer noticed that the food wasn’t hot and asked to see my manager. Basically, I immediately apologized to both the customer and my manager, as well as the cook, because we had to throw out the cold food and remake everything. And it was a mistake on my part, but I helped resolve the situation as fast as possible. The experience taught me to double-check things and stay on top of details, especially in fast-paced environments where small things can have a big impact. I have never make another mistake ever since that while working there.
- For class project where I have to work with multiple people if my part did not work, I will admit it and fix it as soon as possible also hearing advices from my coworkers and apologize for my mistake.

### 传达别人不想听到的消息：

**Time I had to tell somebody they didn’t want to hear:**

- One time, as a TA for the CS 0007 course, I had to let a group of students know that their project didn’t meet the requirements, and also because our auto-grading system flagged their work because it is very similar to a past submission. So, basically I can't give them get a passing grade on the assignment. It wasn’t easy because I knew they had put in a lot of effort, but I still had to tell them.

  I started the conversation with empathy, I explained why their project didn’t meet the criteria, and I walked them through the parts that were missing. And I mostly focused on what was missing from the requirements, and I briefly mentioned the similarity that was flagged by the system. I didn’t go into too much detail about the flagged issue because we were in office hours and there are other people as well and I didn’t want to embarrass them.

## 解决问题与批判性思维（Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking）

### Go against the norm（打破规则）

Did not work overtime at Walmart despite my store manager asked me to.

**Automated Course Registration System (Best Example):**

- One time I went against the norm was when I automated my course registration process. At my school, a third of the students are computer science majors, so getting a seat in the popular classes is really competitive. It was especially stressful because without the required courses, I couldn’t progress and I also I want to graduate half semester early because out of state tuition is quite expensive. So, instead of constantly refreshing the registration page, I modified a Python script to automatically register me in a class as soon as a seat opened up during the last day of registration when they drop all the waitlists. It felt like a creative solution. It saved me a lot of stress and helped me secure the classes I needed. It wasn’t exactly what most students were doing, but I think it is the most efficient way.

**Time Management (Alternative Example):**

- Usually, I follow the norm with academics, but sometimes I’ve had to make exceptions, especially when I fall behind because of bad time management. If a project deadline is coming up and I’m running out of time, I have to work faster than I’d like. In those situations, I try to balance speed with accuracy. I might cut some corners to finish on time, but I always make sure the work is still solid, even if it’s a bit rushed.

### 超常发挥开始->意料之外的情况：

**Unexpected Problem**

**Walmart如果没说的话**

- During my job at Walmart in high school, for some reason they were always short-staffed, so they would just send me into different departments to them help out. It was a very unique experience because I had to not only learn how to work within my own department (I work for the outdoor and garden) and I also quickly learn how to work with new departments(I think I have worked in diary, electronics, OGP online grocery pickup, cashier, stocking, housing etc.) and different managers. Also, I had to learn how to deal with different customers as well because they might ask questions specific to that department that I do not know. Like for cashier, some I had verify their ID before they purchase alcohol or other stuff. For electronics, they might ask me the functionality of certain product, for garden they would ask me like plants specific questions 

  What really helped was focusing on communication and collaboration. Just don't be afraid, always ask for help, be honest with customer if you do not know something. With coworkers I made sure we were all on the same page by listening to others' ideas, and sharing my own. I just tried to keep things moving forward. In the end, even when we were short on people, we managed to get everything done, and it showed me just how important teamwork and clear communication are.

**修改课表，如果没说的话:**

- Last semester when I couldn't get into any classes I want I automated my course registration process. At my school, a third of the students are computer science majors, so getting a seat in the popular classes is really competitive. It was especially stressful because without the required courses, I couldn’t progress and I also I want to graduate half semester early because out of state tuition is quite expensive. So, instead of constantly refreshing the registration page, I modified a Python script to automatically register me in a class as soon as a seat opened up during the last day of registration when they drop all the waitlists. It felt like a creative solution. It saved me a lot of stress and helped me secure the classes I needed. It wasn’t exactly what most students were doing, but I think it is the most efficient way.

**提交作业备用方案:**

- **Situation:**
  When I was a TA for the intro to programming course, we had a in person quiz during our lab, and they have to submit their quiz to Grade Scope online at the end of the lab. But the website was under maintenance.  And we did not realize that because it was working fine before we start the lab, and naturally, everyone started panicking because they worried about their grade.

  **Task:**
  I had to tell them to stay calm and manage the situation to ensure that they can still turn in their assignments on time.

  **Action:**
  The first thing I did was let the professor and other TAs know what was going on so we could all be on the same page. Then, I reassured the them, telling them that we’d extend the deadline while we sorted things out. I also told them to email their work to me or upload it to Google Drive, just in case, we could not fix it by the end of the lab.

  **Result:**
  Eventually, we were able to keep things under control. We told them to just submit their work through emails because we worried the academic integrity violation if we extends the deadline.

### 遇到困难 Get Stuck: 

- **Walmart:** 

  During my job at Walmart in high school, for some reason they were always short-staffed, so they would just send me and other part times into different departments to them help out. It was a very unique experience because I had to not only learn how to work within my own department (I work for the outdoor and garden) and I also quickly learn how to work with new departments(I think I have worked in diary, electronics, OGP online grocery pickup, cashier, stocking, housing etc.) and different managers.

​	如果讲过Walmart就行简单复述一下之前的然后加上下面的

- If the job is more crucial and formal, then you need to prepare more beforehand, make sure you are familiar with the technologies or framing work you are going to be using, again  always ask for help you really need it. take notes for every exception or error or mistake you made along the way and always try to avoid mistake first, handling should be your last resort.

------

### Project要求临时改变

**Tell me a time that requirement has a suddenly changed in your project**

- When I was a TA for the intro to programming course, we had a situation where our professor just changed the project requirements just a few days before the deadline because some students who have taken the course before were posting their projects on GitHub and they made it public so everyone can see it, and our students were taking advantage of that. Plus, AI tools is getting more and more powerful, so our professor wanted to ensure that the assignment couldn’t be solved easily by AI. Originally, the project focused on basic programming concepts, but he changed the assignment to file handling because at that time ChatGPT doesn't support import file yet, and a lot of students were feeling overwhelmed.

  To handle the change, I basically adapted by updating the materials I had prepared for office hours. I also had to redo the project as well because I have to help students. I had to explain the everything in a way that was easier for students to understand and primiarily focused on explaining the new requirement. I also stayed overtime during office hours to help those who needed extra support, making sure they felt comfortable with the new material.

  In the end, most people were able to finish and understand the assignment, and I think the extra effort I put in really helped them get through the sudden change without too much stress.

------

### 快速决定且多方信息矛盾

**Tell us about a situation in which you needed to make an important decision quickly, but were faced with conflicting information from multiple sources. Please describe the situation, your actions, and the outcome of your final decision.**

Helene 发音（Hat layn）

- We had Hurricane Helene in Mid September down here at Atlanta and we were under the severe weather warnings, we had flood and tropical storm watches. As a TA, I was responsible for hosting a weekly lab from 6:30 to 8:00 PM that day. 

  Them I saw some students were making online post to see if it is possible to cancel this week's lab, some students were asking if the attendance could be dropped. Some people still showed up to the lab. 

  Basically, I talked with the professor and other TAs, and we decided to still hold the lab for those who showed up, but we dropped the attendance requirement for everyone so no one would feel pressured to show up if they were worried about the weather. And for the rest of the week, we made all office hours, and lectures virtual to keep everyone safe. 

  In the end, it worked out fine. We managed to accommodate the students who showed up while keeping everyone else safe. It was a tough situation, but I think we made the right decision by balancing safety and what the students needed.

### What does high quality code mean to you?



## **适应性与灵活性（Adaptability & Flexibility & Challenge）**

### Challenge挑战 + 适应 + 舒适区外 + get Stuck + someone very different from you

- **Can you tell me a time where you faced a challenge and how did you overcome that?** 

  I moved to the United States eight years ago. It was quite different for me because I was from a very urbanized area then transition to a small town in Nebraska. Plus, people in small town seems to be more conventional, adjusting to life here wasn’t easy. During my high school, there were no international students, just a few foreign exchange students, and after COVID, I was the only Asian student left. It felt isolating at times, and the environment was completely different from what I was used to. Instead of city streets, I found myself surrounded by cornfields while driving on high way and interstates, and the occasional smell of cow manure—it was far from the urban life I had imagined the U.S. to be, so seeing the rural reality of where I lived was hard to accept at first. You had to drive to everywhere also feels weird because China's public transportation is really good

  The language barrier was another hurdle back then. Especially in an environment where everyone already seemed so comfortable with each other. Making friends was tough, and It was hard for me to fit in initially. There were moments when I missed home deeply, but I knew I couldn’t go back. The only option was to adapt.

  What helped me overcome these challenges was a shift in mindset. I guess, like I started to see things from different perspective. I start to see Nebraska’s rural landscape as something unique, maybe like something that others might never be able to experience. Also, I focused on finding common ground with my classmates. I joined school activities, talked to people more, and also slowly built friendships. I also worked part-time since my sophomore year all the way until I graduated. I learned to adapt to new changes slowly at my own pace, and I think it made me more adaptable to different environments.

​	**Needed to build a relationship with someone very different from you**

​	如果上面移民讲过了就简单复述一下不然直接说移民，然后说你的general approach: During school or job: I tried to really listen to their ideas and understand their perspective. I asked questions to learn more about how they approached problems and shared my thoughts too. Just try to find a common ground and make some compromise and adjustment as needed and be respectful. 你还可以加一下在Walmart 里有些顾客或者甚至是coworker他们都只说西班牙语，

### 舒适区外

- **舒适圈外：Jobs outside of Comfort Zone 如果没说非要是Job的话就讲移民**

  **Walmart的例子之前没讲过的话就照着念**

  **perform skills or meet requirements outside of your comfort zone. How would you approach the situation?**

  **Unexpected Problem, how did I handle**

  During my job at Walmart in high school, for some reason they were always short-staffed, so they would just send me and other part times into different departments to them help out. It was a very unique experience because I had to not only learn how to work within my own department (I work for the outdoor and garden) and I also quickly learn how to work with new departments(I think I have worked in diary, electronics, OGP online grocery pickup, cashier, stocking, housing etc.) and different managers. Also, I had to learn how to deal with different customers as well because they might ask questions specific to that department that I do not know. Like for cashier, some I had verify their ID before they purchase alcohol or other stuff. For electronics, they might ask me the functionality of certain product, for garden they would ask me like plants specific questions 

  What really helped was focusing on communication and collaboration. Just don't be afraid, always ask for help, be honest with customer if you do not know something. With coworkers I made sure we were all on the same page by listening to others' ideas, and sharing my own. I just tried to keep things moving forward. In the end, even when we were short on people, we managed to get everything done, and it showed me just how important teamwork and clear communication are.

  

### 工作环境 Idea work Environment 

- My ideal work environment is in-person because I find that interacting with people face-to-face makes me much more productive. Also since I am an intern, I have a lot to learn, and in-person learning would be more easier for me to understand and remember and also know how to handle different scenario. I enjoy being part of a team also because I think it is impossible to work alone nowadays, you have to interact with people in any job. So, Overall that kind of environment helps me learn and improve. 
- It is easier to learn with real person, which is why they have teacher to teach you during school, technically, all the knowledges are on the textbook, so you could learn everything on your own, but they still decide to teach you in person and with classmates to make the environment more collaborative and competitive.




## 时间管理与多任务处理（Time Management & Multitasking）

### **Managed a long-term assignment**

**Tell us about a time you spent a month or more preparing for an important presentation, research project, or difficult task. Please describe the situation, how you prepared for it, and the outcome.**

Last time I had to prepare for something important over a month was when I was getting ready to apply to college, I always thought that you apply to college during the summer after the senior year, but it was actually the summer after the junior year. Especially for those highly ranked school their first year admission deadline is even earlier. So, I was in a rush. I had roughly 1 month left to prepare for everything and It was quite stressful because I wasn't familiar with the ACT exam content and their science section is not testing the actual science knowledge but more like logical reasoning. I also had to work on the personal statement essay and ask my teachers for letters of recommendations. 

Basically, time management became really important. I spent my mornings doing regular schoolwork, and spent my nights practicing for the exam. I downloaded all the released past exams from the last 20 years for practice. I just break them into smaller tasks, I do the past exam for a one year every single day.

I prioritize difficult areas, math and science were easier for me—I was getting full marks on them after a few practice exams—so I spent the majority of my time on the English and reading sections. I definitely could have done better if I had started earlier, but that was a lesson I learned.







## 成就与失败 (Strength and Weakness)（Achievements & Failures）

### Greatest Achievement

- Moving to a different country, and being able to adjust to it. Urban to Suburb, high school no similar kind, part time job 2nd to 4th, high school transferred,  college transfer from Pitt to Gatech

### Mistake 失败中学到的教训 

**past mistake**

- Not every single college course is important, self learning is very important!

- College ranking does not matter, should I have stayed in Pitt, where do I want to work?

- **Scenarios:** There have been plenty of times when I didn’t meet my own expectations. For example, I did not do well on an exam, saying something I could have phrased better, or not handling a situation with a customer in the best way. 

  **Lessons:** But the most important lesson I’ve learned from these failures is that we’re all human, and we all make mistakes. It’s totally okay to feel bad or even a little down when things don’t go the way you hoped. That’s what makes us different from machines. When a machine encounters a bug, it gets fixed and moves on, never making the same mistake again. But as humans, we might make the same mistake twice, and that’s part of the learning process.

  You need to figure out how to release those negative feelings, whether it’s talking to a friend, going for a walk. The key is not letting those emotions drag you down for too long. That, honestly, is the hardest part of failure. Once you manage that, the rest is just about learning from your mistakes and trying to avoid repeating them.

  And it’s always better to prevent mistakes in the first place. Handling a mistake is the last resort because by then, the damage is already done.

### Strength:                       Why should we hire you/Ideal Candidate(after this mention your relevant course and skills in the intro )

- **Adaptability** :
  Moving to a new country, urban to suburb, high school Schuyler to Columbus, work from 2nd to 4th (China was 7 to 11, here 8 - 3 then 4 - 9), college  Pitt to GT, 

- **Self-learning:** 
  One of my strengths is being a self-learner. Over the summer, I taught myself Spring, SpringMVC, SpringBoot, and Vue by using online resources, tutorials, official documentation, and some full stack projects during my free time. Lately, ChatGPT has made this process even smoother—it’s like a huge time-saver. Instead of searching through Google for answers, GPT just gives me what I need directly. Honestly, I think it’s one of the best inventions of the 21st century because it’s helped me learn so much faster. Right now, I’m working on learning Spring Cloud microservices.

  **Time management:**
  I’m pretty good at managing my time—balancing schoolwork, self-learning, and downtime. I’ve had plenty of times where I’ve been able to get all my projects done, keep learning new things, and still have time to relax. But, time management can be a bit of a double-edged sword for me. Sometimes I procrastinate a little too much and have to reorganize my schedule, but I always find a way to get back on track and meet my deadlines.

  **People skills:**
  I’ve also developed strong people skills. When I worked part-time jobs at Walmart and Hy-Vee during high school, I had to interact with both coworkers and customers, learning how to handle different personalities and situations calmly and professionally. That experience has definitely helped me build strong communication skills, which I know will be useful in any work environment. 

  Also I used to be a teaching assistant for intro to programming course, so I had to interact with students and answer their questions
  
  **Self-discipline:**
  Another strength is my self-discipline. When it comes down to choosing between something fun, like playing video games, and something I need to do, I prioritize what needs to get done. A lot of my personal projects require skills that go beyond what I learn in school since some courses are outdated or too basic. They are important, they don’t really cover the modern frameworks I use. So, I push myself to learn more advanced, real-world skills on my own.

### Weakness:

- **`Hoping for something that is very unlikely to happen`**

  I tend to hope for the best outcome, even when it’s unlikely—like when I applied to MIT, or after an exam, hoping for a perfect score. People always say that you should always have hope for the goods but if you had too much hope and things went bad, then all the hope you have accumulated while waiting for the result might turn into a huge amount of negativity at once and that can be tough to handle.

- **Walmart:**

  One of my weaknesses is that I have a hard time saying no, especially when it comes to helping people. When I worked part-time jobs, my coworkers would always call me to cover their shifts if, and even when I had other stuff going on, I’d usually say yes because I felt bad turning them down. It’s the same with customers—sometimes they’d ask to open a product before buying it, and I’d try to explain why they shouldn’t, but in the end, some customer would still open it after I walk away. 

- Worry about stuff that has not happen yet.

## 学习能力与持续发展（Learning & Continuous Improvement）

### 未来职业计划/Dream Job：

- In the next five years, I see myself working primarily in backend development with Java springboot, springcloud microservice, or maybe full stack, to build up my skills and experience. Along the way, **I want to dive deep into Cybersecurity, either by getting the necessary licenses and certifications or getting an online master while working. My goal is to eventually make a shift from backend development into Cybersecurity. I think the combination of both skill sets will give me a lot of opportunities in the future.**
- 问的是Dream的话下面再加上这个：Also, I think Cybersecurity seems to be cool because the general impression when I was young about programming is like those hacker in the movie.

### 感兴趣的方向：

**Area that you are interested in the most**

- Initially, it was frontend because I learned html css, js right after my first programming language java, it was interesting because you get to see the stuff instantly, instant feedback and feel accomplished. Feels like drawing pictures. I also realize that it is quite timing consuming to make a nice website from scratch and especially with the recent advance in AI that can even make a website for you by your verbal description.

  then I learned backend sprinboot and learned how to implement a database, how to receive request from the frontend, and how to send the result back to the frontend. I want to dive deep into Cybersecurity, either by getting the necessary licenses and certifications or getting an online graduate master while working. My goal is to eventually make a shift from backend development into Cybersecurity. 

### 自学了新的技术(New Skill Set):

- **Over the summer, I taught myself Spring, SpringMVC, SpringBoot, and Vue by using online resources, tutorials, official documentation, and I did some full stack projects during my free time. Lately, ChatGPT has made this process even smoother—it’s like a huge time-saver.** Instead of searching through Google for answers, GPT just gives me what I need directly. Honestly, I think it’s one of the best inventions of the 21st century because it’s helped me learn so much faster. **Right now, I’m working on learning Spring Cloud microservices because I think it will be useful in the future.**
- If I have others around me or I am in School， Just don't be afraid, always ask for help, no one knows you are struggling until you reach out)

### 想从该公司实习经历中学到什么？技巧问一下他们的技术栈

## 问Recruiter的问题

- I was first going to ask what projects interns in the past have worked on?
- What was one of the most difficult technical difficulties you ever encountered?
- Can you describe A day in the life at .....
- Do not ask if you did not do well: If you were to hire me right now, where would you place me based on my skill set?
- How would you define success as an intern? 

## 结束告别

Thank you so much for talking to me today. I really appreciate it. 

Thanks again, take care



## 技术方面

### **Agile:**

- It is like a software development methodology. It is very theory based. It breaks up the project development into multiple stages, you can also call that sprints. You have to follow Plan, Design, Develop, Test, Deploy, and Review these 6 steps for each sprint.
- Did not strictly following these because let's say that you are on sprint 3 doing Testing and some stuff in sprint 1 went wrong. You probably won't go through the same steps for sprint 1 again.

------

### **Jira：**

![image-20241011115636563](破题图片\image-20241011115636563.png)

- It’s basically a tool that helps teams manage their work, especially for software development. You can track tasks, bugs, and projects all in one place. I know it’s pretty common for agile development. It’s super helpful for keeping everyone on the same page. Honestly, It's kind of like an advanced version of google calendar. You basically have 4 columns on the board. You have TO DO, In Progress, Code Review, and Done. Everyone just gets their own ticket, and once you are done just move your ticket forward to a different column


------

### **Scrum:**

- Scrum is an Agile framework that helps manage software projects. It breaks project into smaller part called sprints, which usually last for a few weeks. It involves three main roles: You have the **Product Owner**, who prioritizes tasks based on the needs; the **Scrum Master**, who makes sure everyone follows the process smoothly; and the **Development Team**, who builds the product. 

- 下面的如果问了才说不然显得假：Work is organized in a **Product Backlog** (all the features and tasks) and a **Sprint Backlog** (what we plan to do in the current sprint). Key meetings include **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Stand-Ups** to track progress, **Sprint Reviews** to get feedback, and **Retrospectives** to improve for next time. 

------

### **Git:**

- Git has **four stages**:
  1. **Working Directory**: Where you modify files locally.
  2. **Staging Area**: Use `git add` to stage changes for the next commit.
  3. **Local Repository**: Commit staged changes using `git commit`, creating a version in your local repo.
  4. **Remote Repository**: Push local commits to a shared remote repo (e.g., GitHub) using `git push` for collaboration and backup.

1. **Repositories**:

- **Repository** stores project files and history, either **local** or **remote** (e.g., GitHub).
- **Clone**: `git clone` copies a remote repo to your local machine.

2. **Staging and Commits**:

- **Staging Area**: `git add <filename>` adds files to prepare for commit.
- **Commit**: `git commit -m "message"` creates a version snapshot.

3. **Branches**:

- **Branch**: `git branch <branch-name>` creates a branch for separate work. Switch with `git checkout`.
- **Merge**: `git merge <branch-name>` integrates changes from one branch to another.

4. **Pull and Push**:

- **Push**: `git push origin <branch-name>` shares commits to a remote repo.
- **Pull**: `git pull` fetches and merges changes from the remote repo.

5. **Status and Logs**:

- **Status**: `git status` shows the state of your working directory.
- **Log**: `git log` displays commit history.

6. **Fetch and Rebase**:

- **Fetch**: `git fetch` downloads changes without applying them.
- **Rebase**: `git rebase <branch-name>` repositions commits to keep branches up to date.

7. **Undoing Changes**:

- **Reset**: `git reset` undoes commits.
- **Revert**: `git revert <commit>` undoes a specific commit while preserving history.
- **Checkout**: `git checkout -- <filename>` discards changes in a file.

**Git Workflow**:

- Create **feature branches** for individual tasks.
- Use **pull requests** for code reviews before merging.

------

### **REST(RESTFUL) API(representational state transfer):**

- RESTful is a software architectural style based on HTTP ,and it is a standard design principle.

- It teaches you => how to design access paths, set request parameter types, and choose request methods.

- Each resource is identified by URI, and we access them through URL:**URI 就像人的名字，用来识别谁是谁，而 URL 就像地址，告诉你如何找到这个人。URL is a subset of URI. **Every URL is a URI because it identifies and locates a resource. Not every URI is a URL.

- 使用标准的 HTTP 方法:

  - `GET`: 用于获取资源。可以通过浏览器地址栏直接输入 URL 来发起。问号后面加参数
  - `POST`: 用于创建新资源。需要通过表单提交、JavaScript、或工具（**如 Postman**）来发起。
  - `PUT`: 用于更新资源。需要通过表单提交、JavaScript、或工具（**如 Postman**）来发起。
  - `DELETE`: 用于删除资源。需要通过表单提交、JavaScript、或工具（**如 Postman**）来发起。

- **资源的表现形式是 JSON 或 XML**: 数据通常以 JSON 或 XML 格式传输。

- 传统风格的 URL 通常带有动词，如 `/CRUD/saveEmp`，而 RESTful 风格的 URL 使用名词表示资源，如 `/CRUD/emp`。

  | 操作 | 传统风格                  | RESTful 风格                          |
  | ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | 保存 | `/CRUD/saveEmp`           | URL: `/CRUD/emp` 请求方式: `POST`     |
  | 删除 | `/CRUD/removeEmp?empId=2` | URL: `/CRUD/emp/2` 请求方式: `DELETE` |
  | 更新 | `/CRUD/updateEmp`         | URL: `/CRUD/emp` 请求方式: `PUT`      |
  | 查询 | `/CRUD/editEmp?empId=2`   | URL: `/CRUD/emp/2` 请求方式: `GET`    |

### Hackathon:

I have done one of them back when I was freshman in the university of Pittsburgh, I did my freshman year there then I transferred to Georgia Tech.  It was sponsored by the their School of Pharmacy because Pitt is famous for its on medical field and healthcare, they have UPMC, and this hackathon was related to healthcare. My team and I didn’t have much experience in the healthcare, so it was very hard for us and we didn’t end up winning any prizes. But it was a really valuable experience. And I remember their awards were very good, the first place gets 3000 dollars, second place was 2000 and 1000 for the third place.

------

### AWS

End up removing it because it charges me for every single text message and I did not deploy the project, so there is no point for that, plus deploying it would also charge me.

1. **Set Up AWS SNS for SMS**

1. **Sign up for AWS SNS**: Go to the [AWS SNS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/) and create an account if you haven’t already.
2. **Request SMS Permissions (if necessary)**: For some AWS regions, you might need to request higher SMS sending limits. Check the SMS settings in SNS to see if additional steps are required.
3. Get Your AWS Credentials:
   - In the AWS Console, go to **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) and create a new user (or use an existing one) with **programmatic access** and **SNS permissions**.
   - Download the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for use in your project.

2. **Configure AWS SDK in Your Spring Boot Project**

1. Add AWS SDK Dependencies: Add the AWS SDK for SNS to your project in pom.xml

   ```pom
   <dependency>    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
       <artifactId>sns</artifactId>
       <version>2.17.125</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Set up your AWS credentials. You can either:

   - Use the `application.properties` in Spring Boot:

     ```properties
     eaws.accessKeyId=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
     aws.secretAccessKey=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
     aws.region=YOUR_AWS_REGION
     ```

   - **Store them securely** in AWS Systems Manager or another secret manager, or in environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive data.

3. **Create the Login Function to Send SMS**

1. **Initialize the SNS Client**: In your Spring Boot project, create a service that will handle SMS sending with AWS SNS.
2. **Use the Service in the Login Function**: Now, in your login function, inject this `SnsService` and call `sendSms` whenever a login occurs.
3. **Test the Login Function**:
   - Start your Spring Boot application.
   - Call the `/login` endpoint with appropriate login credentials.
   - Upon successful login, you should receive a text message on the specified phone number.

4. **Set Up Error Handling and Limits**

- **Error Handling**: Make sure to handle potential errors (like invalid phone numbers or SNS rate limits) and log them appropriately.
- **Throttle SMS Requests**: For security and cost efficiency, consider adding a limit to the number of SMS messages sent per user per day to avoid excessive charges.

------

### Google Cloud

 To deploy a Vue.js + Spring Boot application to Google Cloud Platform.

They gave us a code to avoid the cost

1. **Set Up Google Cloud Project**

- Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project.
- Enable the **Google Cloud Build**, **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, and **Cloud SQL** (if you need a database) APIs.

2. **Deploy the Backend (Spring Boot)**

You can deploy your backend Spring Boot application in a few ways on Google Cloud:

Option 1: Deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) 不是很常用所以没用

- Containerize the Application: Create a Dockerfile for the Spring Boot app:

  ```
  DockerfileCopy codeFROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
  VOLUME /tmp
  ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
  COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
  ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
  ```

- Build and Push Docker Image

**Option 2: Deploy to App Engine (Flexible Environment)**

- App.yaml Configuration: Create an 

  ```
  app.yaml
  ```

   in your Spring Boot project root.

  ```yml
  runtime: java
  env: flex
  ```

- Deploy:

  ```bash
  gcloud app deploy
  ```

3. **Deploy the Frontend (Vue)**

The Vue frontend can be hosted in **Google Cloud Storage** (as a static website) or **Google App Engine**.

Deploy to App Engine (Standard Environment)

- Create an app.yaml file in the Vue project’s root directory:

  ```yml
  runtime: nodejs14
  handlers:
  - url: /
    static_files: dist/index.html
    upload: dist/index.html
  - url: /
    static_dir: dist
  ```

- Deploy to App Engine:

  ```yml
  gcloud app deploy
  ```

4. **Connect Frontend and Backend**

- Use the public IP address or URL of your backend service (from GKE LoadBalancer or App Engine) in the Vue app’s environment variables. Set the base URL for API calls to the backend.

- Update environment variables in your Vue project and rebuild:

  ```
  // For example, in .env.production
  VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url
  ```

5. **Set Up Database (Optional)**

- If your backend requires a database, use **Cloud SQL** to set up a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
- Connect to the Cloud SQL instance from your Spring Boot application by configuring the database URL and credentials in the `application.properties` file.

------

### Testing

For backend Springboot, maven has a very organized project structure

- import Junit test dependency in pom
- make a object of the class you are trying to test, given the same input check expected output vs actual output

![image-20241107113456517](破题图片\image-20241107113456517.png)<img src="破题图片\image-20241107113550345.png" alt="image-20241107113550345" style="zoom:50%;" /> 

**Testing API Endpoints**

- **Postman or Swagger UI:** Test individual API endpoints using **Postman** or **Swagger UI** (if you’ve set it up in your project).

**Testing Frontend:**

- npm run dev

- right click inspect -> console
